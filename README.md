## Intent

The documents and resources in this repo define a quality baseline for HTML, CSS (Sass), and other Front End protocols and languages as additions are made. The purpose is to improve overall code quality and consistency, enable better use of linters, and make it easier on incoming developers or for those transferring from team to team.

This guide is intended to be a living document. The core best practices should remain constant as long as they are applicable but *additions and modifications are encouraged* as Client Side teams evolve.

***Be consistent.***

If you are on a team that has chosen to move away from this baseline for reasons of complexity, differing opinion, or any other reason - follow that teams lead.

The point of this is not to enforce absolute rules that cannot be broken, but instead provide general guides and best practices.
